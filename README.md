# WolframNETLink ðŸ’¥ðŸ”— - Some _More_ Tests ðŸ¥¼

This spring I was [interested in calling Wolfram (specifically: loading expressions) in .NET](https://github.com/heseltime/SWK5-W-WolframNETLink) - **but what about the other direction, bringing .NET (classes, objects, anything else (?)) into Wolfram, specifically a notebook environment?**

## The Vision: _A .NET system with Mathematica insight opportunity, perhaps, or a partly notebook-triggered functionality (and response evaluation)_

A bit of LLM kitch: we'll work on that.
